                            The Triforce of Courage contains the divine essence of Farore, the Goddess of Courage, who is renowned for creating all life that inhabits the Hyrulean realm. It is usually associated specifically with Link. The Triforce of Courage is typically portrayed as the bottom-right piece of the Triforce.

                        <p>
                            It is unclear what specific benefits the Triforce of Courage affords its user, but the holder of the Triforce of Courage is imbued with Farore's essence, and afforded attributes analogous to those of the Goddess of Courage herself. Link seems to have an affinity for Farore's color, green.

                        <p>
                            The Triforce of Courage also seems to afford its wielder an unknown degree of protection from certain forms of magic, and transformation. In Twilight Princess, when Link entered the Twilight-afflicted regions of Hyrule, the Triforce of Courage prevented him from becoming a lost soul like the 
                            other denizens of Hyrule, and instead transformed him into a divine wolf. Although the Triforce is seen in Twilight Princess, it is never explicitly mentioned by name. According to the website, it is also believed that Link has the ability to master any weapon he wields due to the Triforce of Courage. 
                            The Triforce of Courage first appeared in The Adventure of Link, sealed within the Great Palace, and is required in the game by Link to awaken the sleeping Zelda. In Ocarina of Time, Link unknowingly obtains the Triforce of Courage while trapped in the sacred realm, after Ganondorf fails to claim the 
                            complete Triforce, splitting it into its three components. In Twilight Princess, it is implicitly indicated that Link carried the Triforce of Courage throughout his entire life, as he bears the crest on his hand at all times. The Triforce of Courage can be seen on a small banner above the entrance of Link's home in Ordon Village.

                            In the cinematic introduction of The Wind Waker, it is stated that when the Hero left Hyrule the Triforce of Courage was broken into eight pieces and scattered across the land, to be recovered one day by another hero deserving of its power. After restoring the power of the Master Sword in The Wind Waker, 
                            Link locates and hauls up all eight shards of the Triforce of Courage from the sea. After he acquires all eight pieces and prepares to face Ganon, the reassembled Triforce of Courage absorbs into his hand. He is then declared the Hero of Winds.

                            In A Link Between Worlds, Link with the Triforce of Courage in his possession was able to defeat Yuga-Ganon, even though he possessed both the Triforce of Power and Triforce of Wisdom. Though in addition to the Triforce of Courage, Link also possessed the Master Sword (which blade may or may not have been upgraded using Master Ore)
                            and Zelda's Bow of Light which fires arrows imbued with a portion of the Triforce's power. It is also implied that Lorule's Triforce has a Triforce of Courage as well

                            In Hyrule Warriors, the young Hyrulian Army Trainee, Link is revealed to be the current incarnation of the Hero of Hyrule during a battle with the Dragon Knight Volga, when he briefly summons Triforce of Courage's power to defend the Sheikah General Impa from Volga's flames. Upon seeing Link's glowing Triforce mark, his innate strength,
                            and skills she becomes convinced that Link is the current incarnation of the Hero, later giving him the Hero's Tunic to wear. Link possesses the Triforce of Courage early in the game, though it is later stolen by Cia along with Sheik's Triforce of Wisdom. However, when Ganondorf partially revives himself, Cia returns the Triforce of Courage 
                            and Wisdom to their original bearers. As a result, Link regains his Triforce of Courage while Zelda regains her Triforce of Wisdom. Zelda then has Link retrieve the Master Sword in order to defeat Cia who still possesses the Triforce of Power. However, during the forces of Hyrule's assault on Cia's stronghold in the Temple of Souls, 
                            Link becomes overconfident due to possessing both the Triforce of Courage and the mighty Master Sword, allowing Cia to tap into the darkness within the Hero's soul, allowing her to spawn Dark Links to fight Link and the Forces of Hyrule. To make matters worse, Ganondorf arrives to reclaim the Triforce of Power, though fortunately the bond 
                            between Link and his allies manages to awaken the Master Sword's true power allowing them to defeat the Dark Links and Ganondorf. Together with his allies Link manages to defeat Cia. After Lana claims the Triforce of Power, Link joins her and Zelda in using the Triforce to restore Hyrule back to normal. Afterwards the Triforce is split between 
                            them with Link retaking possession of the Triforce of Courage while Zelda and Lana carry the other two thirds. However, due to Link's removal of the Master Sword the seal on the final piece of Ganondorf's soul is broken allowing the King of Evil to revive himself. With the aid of Ghirahim and Zant, Ganondorf reclaims the Triforce of Power from Lana
                            and eventually manages to claim the other pieces from Link and Zelda, though he is ultimately defeated by Link, Zelda, Lana, and their allies.
