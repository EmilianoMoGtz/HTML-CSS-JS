                            The Triforce of Power embodies the essence of Din, the Goddess of Power, who used her "strong flaming arms" to shape the land and cultivate the red earth on which Hyrule exists.
                            Her divine essence grants the holder of the Triforce of Power an unlimited amount of mystical power. It is usually associated specifically with Ganon, who uses its vast power to his own evil ends.
                             The top triangle in the Triforce represents the Triforce of Power.

                        <p>
                            It appears in The Legend of Zelda. The back-story given was that Ganon gained it by thievery. Link acquires it after defeating Ganon inside Death Mountain.

                            In Ocarina of Time, Ganondorf (the Gerudo king) heard of the legend of the Triforce and lusted after its power, primarily as a tool to subjugate the kingdom of Hyrule and expand his influence. 
                            Inadvertently aided by Link and the Hylian princess Zelda, Ganondorf eventually finds his way into the Sacred Realm. Ganondorf did not know that to claim the complete Triforce, one must have 
                            in their heart a balance of three virtues represented by each of the three pieces of the Triforce: power, wisdom, and courage. As his heart did not contain in it this balance, the Triforce 
                            splits into its three components, leaving Ganondorf with only the piece representing the characteristic he values most, the Triforce of Power.[3] The remaining pieces are sealed in "those chosen by destiny": 
                            the Triforce of Courage in Link and the Triforce of Wisdom in Zelda. Each of the three received the mark of the Triforce on the back of one hand. Although Ganon suffers defeat at the hands of Link and is banished 
                            to the Sacred Realm by the power of the Seven Sages, he retains the Triforce of Power. Link and Zelda also retain their Triforce pieces.

                            In the back-story of Twilight Princess, the Triforce of Power, along with his own dark magic (which is rejuvenated by being close to the malice and hatred of the execution grounds), allowed Ganondorf to survive 
                            his execution at the hands of the Ancient Sages. At the end of the game, Link defeats him by using the Master Sword to impale him through the wound on his chest, and as Ganondorf grows weak, the Triforce crest fades from his hand.

                            In Hyrule Warriors, a fragment of Ganondorf's soul uses his power to remove the light (which became the White Sorceress, Lana) from the soul of the Guardian of Time transforming her into the Dark Sorceress, Cia. 
                            The fragment granted Cia the Triforce of Power to free the other pieces of Ganondorf's soul. Cia manages to obtain the Triforce of Wisdom from Sheik and Triforce of Courage from Link and uses it power to summon 
                            the different eras where the other fragments of Ganondorf's soul were sealed. Cia's forces managed to break the seal on several fragments save for the final fragment which was held under seal by the Master Sword. 
                            Deciding he no longer needed Cia, Ganondorf revealed himself and attempted to seize the completed Triforce from Cia, but she managed to return the Triforce of Wisdom and Triforce of Courage back to their original
                            owners to keep them out of Ganondorf's grasp, Zelda and Link. Cia than manages to reseal Ganondorf briefly due to him lacking the final piece of his soul, while retaining the Triforce of Power for herself. She tries 
                            desperately to regain the other pieces, though the allied Forces of Hyrule along with Lana, manage to defeat Cia's forces. Cia is eventually defeated and dies, with Lana taking possession of the Triforce of Power,
                            becoming its first bearer to lack an evil heart. Together with the other Triforce bearers, Lana uses its power to help restore Hyrule to normal. However Ganondorf is able to completely revive as Link had removed 
                            the Master Sword in order to defeat Cia and her forces, weakening the seal on the last fragment of Ganondorf's soul. Ganondorf revives Ghirahim and Zant and rebuilds his dark army to reclaim his Triforce of Power 
                            along with the remaining Triforce pieces. Ganondorf attacks Lana in the valley of Seers to reclaim his Triforce of Power, though Zelda sends Impa to assist her in retreating from Ganondorf's army. While in possession 
                            of the Triforce of Power, Lana gains the ability to split her soul which she uses to flee from Ganondorf though ultimately he manages to reclaim the Triforce of Power from her and once again sets his sights on obtaining the complete Triforce.

                            In A Link Between Worlds, the Lorulean Wizard Yuga kidnaps the Seven Sages in order to resurrect Ganon so he can fuse with him to gain his Triforce of Power. It is later revealed that Princess Hilda was working with Yuga to steal Hyrule's 
                            Triforce in order to restore her kingdom. When Yuga-Ganon is defeated by Link, Hilda orders Yuga to give her the Triforce of Power, but Yuga reveals he has no intention of saving Lorule as he reveals he desired the Triforce to become a God 
                            and planned to remake Lorule in his image. He then transforms Hilda into a painting in order to claim the Triforce of Wisdom. Yuga-Ganon is then transformed by possessing two pieces of the Triforce and attacks Link to obtain his Triforce of Courage. 
                            However even with the combined might of Power and Wisdom, he is defeated by Link.
