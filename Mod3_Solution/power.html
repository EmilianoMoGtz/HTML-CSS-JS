                        The Triforce of Wisdom holds the essence of Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom, who is recognized for creating the physical laws of the realm of Hyrule. It is usually associated with Princess Zelda, 
                        and in most games, she possesses it. When activated, the lower left triangle in the Triforce mark on Zelda's hand glows, representing the Triforce of Wisdom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Though Zelda is known to possess innate mystical powers, the essence of Nayru, wielded by Zelda using the Triforce of Wisdom, enhances these abilities. In various incarnations, Zelda has 
                        demonstrated telepathy, precognition, and mystic energy projection, among other abilities.
                        </p>

                        Seemingly by means of the Triforce's power, Zelda demonstrated shapeshifting abilities in Ocarina of Time. To hide herself from Ganondorf, Zelda assumes the guise of a young Sheikah man who
                        calls himself Sheik, one of the few remaining Sheikah. In Twilight Princess, Zelda used the power of the Triforce of Wisdom to detect the dark magic trapping Link in his wolf form, and it 
                        may have granted her the power to remain in her true form in the Twilight. The Triforce of Wisdom may have been used to save Midna's life and transfer Zelda's light or soul into Midna to give 
                        her the ability to survive the light of Hyrule. Zelda, after being revived, states to Midna, "Our souls were one, however briefly."<br>

                        <p>
                            In The Wind Waker, Tetra carries a necklace made from most of the Triforce of Wisdom; the King of Hyrule carries the other part of it. When the two pieces are reunited, Tetra's true identity is revealed to be Zelda.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In A Link Between Worlds, the Triforce of Wisdom is taken from Zelda by Princess Hilda as part of her plot to seize Hyrule's Triforce only for it to be later stolen by Yuga-Ganon. While in possession of both the
                            Triforce of Wisdom and Triforce of Power, Yuga-Ganon is granted a more powerful form capable of levitation. However even with the power of two Triforce pieces, he is still defeated by the combined might of Link's 
                            Triforce of Courage and Master Sword.
                        </p>

                            In Hyrule Warriors, the Triforce of Wisdom is in the possession of the game's incarnation of Zelda, who transforms into Sheik to hide from Cia's forces. However, she is unaware that Cia possesses Ganondorf's Triforce
                            of Power and when Sheik joins Link in confronting Cia, the presence of all three Triforce bearers causes each of their Triforce marks to glow due to being in close proximity to each other. This allows Cia to steal both 
                            of their Triforce pieces and uses the complete Triforce to summon different eras where the pieces of Ganondorf's soul are sealed. However, Cia is later forced to return the Triforce of Wisdom and Triforce of Courage to 
                            their original bearers when Ganondorf manages to partially revive himself to keep them from falling into the King of Evil's hands. Zelda is shown to be able to maintain her Sheik disguise even after the Triforce of Wisdom 
                            is taken from her.
