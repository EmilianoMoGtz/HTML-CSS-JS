                    It is usually associated with Princess Zelda, and in most games, she possesses it. 
                    When activated, the lower left triangle in the Triforce mark on Zelda's hand glows.

                    The Triforce of Courage contains the divine essence of Farore, the Goddess of Courage,
                    who is renowned for creating all life that inhabits the Hyrulean realm. It is usually 
                    associated specifically with Link. The Triforce of Courage is typically portrayed as 
                    the bottom-right piece of the Triforce.

                    the Goddess of Power, who used her "strong flaming arms" 
                    to shape the land and cultivate the red earth on which Hyrule exists.
                    Her divine essence grants the holder of the Triforce of Power an unlimited 
                    amount of mystical power.
